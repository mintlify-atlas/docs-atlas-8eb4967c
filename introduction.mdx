# Django SuperApp

**Django SuperApp** boosts developer efficiency by allowing them to start projects quickly with **pre-built standalone apps**. Each app has its own `settings.py` and `urls.py` files, which are automatically recognized by the system. This modular setup makes Django projects more organized and scalable, saving developers time and effort.
